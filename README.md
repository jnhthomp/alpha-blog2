# TODO
* Extract all forms and cards from views to partials
  * Try to share similar partials in a single file
  * Maybe an arguement could be passed from where it is called (along with the object to render)
    That arguement would determine which form gets loaded based off an if statement in the partial
    Then we could pass in which form we want to request all to the same form partial
     and the partial would render the correct form in the view
* Add comments for everything so far
* Update readme to document what is going on with the application
* Add tests for User and Articles models, controllers, functions

* Integrate ActionCable for a chat/messaging section

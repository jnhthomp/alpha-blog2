# TODO
* Remove div from displaying when there is no pagination needed
* Add comments for everything so far
* Update readme to document what is going on with the application
* Update css to fix centering on some buttons (delete in user show as admin)
  * Issue is that btn-danger has a margin on it for when success/primary/danger are all side by side
    this offsets the button when it is used regularly
